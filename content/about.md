## The Art of the Passable

Somewhat tongue in cheek, this site is a place to muse about doing government better, sometimes through technology.

### About me

I lead the Canada School of the Public Service's Digital Academy. We are responsible for improving the digital literacy of public servants in the Government of Canada, building deeper competencies in key areas like data, AI/ML, design, DevOps and disruptive technology, and building communities to support learning and organizational/cultural change.

I've been working in government for 19 years across operations, policing, immigration, national security, policy, major projects, air travel, open source collaboration and leadership.

I'm a self-driven continuous learner. I play with Rust, Python, Golang, JS, SQL and tinker with Vue.js and React. My passions are network analytics and systems - seeing the connections in our environments and between our organizations.

I've taught Web design, network analytics and machine learning at Python meetups, security meetups and conferences.
